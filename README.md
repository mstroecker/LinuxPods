# LinuxPods

A modern Linux desktop application for managing Apple AirPods with a native GNOME interface.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in very early development. README and documentation may be inaccurate, and many features are not yet implemented.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented

- **Real-Time Battery Monitoring**: View live battery levels for left AirPod, right AirPod, and charging case
  - **Automatic Source Selection**: AAP (accurate, 1%) when connected, BLE (1-10%) otherwise
  - **AAP Integration**: Apple Accessory Protocol over L2CAP for precise battery monitoring
  - **BLE Scanning with Optional Decryption**:
    - Unencrypted: ~10% accuracy (no key required)
    - Encrypted: 1% accuracy (requires one-time key retrieval via AAP)
  - Passive monitoring works while AirPods connected to other devices
  - Charging status indicators (âš¡) and in-ear detection (ðŸ‘‚)
- **System Tray Integration**: Battery levels and quick actions in system tray
- **GNOME Settings Integration**: Battery information appears in GNOME Settings â†’ Power panel (lowest battery level)
- **Native GNOME Design**: Built with libadwaita following GNOME Human Interface Guidelines

### ðŸš§ Planned

- **Noise Control**: Switch between Transparency, Adaptive, Noise Cancelling, and Off modes (UI ready, protocol TBD)
- **Conversation Awareness**: Toggle to lower media volume when you start speaking (UI ready, protocol TBD)

## Supported Devices

- **Apple AirPods Pro 3**: Tested and fully supported
- **Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)**: Tested and fully supported
- **Other Apple AirPods**: Not tested, may work

## Requirements

### Runtime Dependencies

- GTK4
- libadwaita
- Go 1.25+ (for building)

### Installation

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S gtk4 libadwaita go
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev golang
```

**NixOS:**

```bash
nix-shell -p gtk4 libadwaita go
```

## Building

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/mstroecker/LinuxPods.git
cd linuxpods
go mod download

# Build (using Makefile - recommended)
make build

# Or build directly with go
go build -o linuxpods ./cmd/gui

# Build all debug tools
make tools

# Run
./linuxpods
```

## Usage

### Main Application

Launch the application:

```bash
./linuxpods
```

The application provides:
- **Main Window**: View all three battery levels, charging status, and in-ear detection
- **System Tray**: Quick access to battery info and app controls (right-click tray icon)
- **GNOME Settings**: Battery appears in Settings â†’ Power (shows lowest battery)
- **Automatic Data Source**: Uses AAP (accurate) when connected, BLE (approximate) otherwise

**How it works:**
1. App starts with BLE scanning for passive battery monitoring
2. When AirPods connect to your computer, app automatically:
   - Detects the connection via BlueZ
   - Establishes AAP connection for accurate battery data
   - Switches to using AAP for all battery updates
3. When AirPods disconnect, app falls back to BLE scanning

### Debugging Tools (Development/Testing)

LinuxPods includes several debugging tools for testing different components:

**debug_ble** - BLE advertisement scanner with optional decryption:
```bash
# Unencrypted only (~10% accuracy)
go run ./cmd/debug_ble

# With decryption (1% accuracy)
go run ./cmd/debug_ble <ENCRYPTION_KEY>
```
Passively scans for AirPods BLE advertisements and parses Apple Continuity protocol. Works even when AirPods are connected to another device. Supports optional decryption for accurate battery levels.

**debug_aap** - AAP protocol client:
```bash
go run ./cmd/debug_aap <MAC_ADDRESS>
# Example: go run ./cmd/debug_aap 90:62:3F:59:00:2F
```
Tests direct L2CAP connection to AirPods using Apple Accessory Protocol (AAP). Displays raw packets and parsed battery information.

**debug_aap_key_retrieval** - Retrieve encryption keys:
```bash
go run ./cmd/debug_aap_key_retrieval <MAC_ADDRESS>
# Example: go run ./cmd/debug_aap_key_retrieval 90:62:3F:59:00:2F
```
Retrieves proximity pairing encryption keys (IRK and ENC_KEY) from AirPods via AAP connection. The ENC_KEY is used to decrypt BLE advertisements for 1% battery accuracy.

**debug_decrypt_test** - Test BLE parsing and decryption:
```bash
# Unencrypted only
go run ./cmd/debug_decrypt_test

# With decryption
go run ./cmd/debug_decrypt_test <ENCRYPTION_KEY>
```
Tests BLE advertisement parsing and decryption with a hardcoded payload. Useful for verifying encryption keys and understanding the protocol.

**debug_bluez_dbus_discover** - BlueZ device discovery:
```bash
go run ./cmd/debug_bluez_dbus_discover
```
Queries BlueZ D-Bus API to discover paired AirPods and display all device properties, interfaces, and services.

**debug_bluez_dbus_battery** - Battery provider integration test:
```bash
go run ./cmd/debug_bluez_dbus_battery full
```
Tests BlueZ Battery Provider D-Bus API implementation. Verifies batteries appear correctly in GNOME Settings.

### Technology Stack

This project uses [gotk4](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4)
and [gotk4-adwaita](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-adwaita) - Go bindings for GTK4 and libadwaita.

**Why libadwaita?** It provides polished, pre-styled components that match GNOME Settings and follow the GNOME Human
Interface Guidelines.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install Go dependencies
go get github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/pkg/gtk/v4
go get github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-adwaita/pkg/adw

# Development build with race detector
go build -race -o linuxpods ./cmd/gui

# Run with GTK inspector for debugging
GTK_DEBUG=interactive ./linuxpods
```

### Architecture

#### State Coordination

LinuxPods uses a centralized `PodStateCoordinator` that coordinates all AirPods state data:

```
PodStateCoordinator (central state)
    â”œâ”€ AAP Client â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€> Active connection for accurate battery (when connected)
    â”œâ”€ BLE Scanner â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€> Passive scanning (fallback or when disconnected)
    â”œâ”€ Automatic Switching â”€â”€> Prefers AAP, falls back to BLE
    â”œâ”€ Updates via callbacks:
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ UI Window â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€> Updates battery widgets
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ System Tray â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€> Updates tray menu
    â”‚   â””â”€ BlueZ Provider â”€â”€â”€> Updates GNOME Settings
```

**Two Battery Data Sources (Automatically Selected):**

1. **AAP Client** (Active, 1% accuracy) - **Primary when connected**
   - Apple Accessory Protocol over L2CAP (PSM 4097)
   - Requires AirPods to be connected to Linux via Bluetooth
   - Real-time updates (<1 second)
   - Accurate battery percentages (1% precision)
   - Automatically used when AirPods connect

2. **BLE Scanning** (Passive, 1-10% accuracy) - **Fallback**
   - Scans Apple Continuity proximity pairing advertisements
   - Works while AirPods are connected to other devices (e.g., iPhone)
   - No connection required, updates every 30-60 seconds
   - **Two-tier accuracy system**:
     - **Unencrypted**: ~10% accuracy (no key required)
     - **Encrypted**: 1% accuracy (requires one-time key retrieval via AAP)
   - See `docs/ble-proximity-pairing.md` and `docs/aap-key-retrieval.md` for protocol details

#### BlueZ Integration

LinuxPods implements BlueZ's Battery Provider D-Bus API (`org.bluez.BatteryProvider1`):

- Battery appears in GNOME Settings â†’ Power panel
- Shows **lowest battery level** (most useful for knowing when to charge)
- Proper D-Bus ObjectManager pattern with InterfacesAdded/Removed signals

**Note**: BlueZ displays one battery per device. Use LinuxPods app to view all three batteries separately.
